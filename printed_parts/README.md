3D Printable Enclosure for MiniMax8085

## Description
This is a 3D printable enclosure for MiniMax8085. This design is an updated version of
[MiniMax 8085 Case by Douglas Martins](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3399973),
which in its turn is based on the [OpenSCAD Parametric Box by FB Aka Heartman/Hearty](http://heartygfx.blogspot.com)
I've fixed a few dimensions,
and I also modified it to work with the DC jack and the tactile switch with the projected plunger and 4x4 key top that I use.

### 3D Printing Recommendations

Print these parts with the "flat face" down. Use rotate option in your slicer software to rotate parts accordingly.
I recommend printing the front and the back parts with the outer side facing the printer bed for more even, higher quality finish.
Make sure to clean any 3D printing artifacts prior to assembling the case.
Use a 2.8 mm (7/64") drill bit to clean the holes in the standoffs and the holes in the mounting "ears" on the top and bottom parts.
Use a 3.2 mm (1/8") drill bit to clean the outer holes on the top and bottom parts.
